            <p> In the past four years, I have reported for metro and community newspapers such as The Kansas City Star, The Columbia Missourian, The Washington Missourian, The Oklahoman and The Maneater, Mizzou's student newspaper. I spent two years on The Columbia Missourian's higher education beat, which included breaking news and enterprise coverage of the graduate rights and Concerned Student 1950 protests during the fall of 2015. </p>

            <p class="description">I created an interactive timeline with another editor using Timeline JS to contextualize the events of the tumultuous fall 2015 semester at the University of Missouri. It was cited by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/10/us/university-of-missouri-system-president-resigns.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/11/09/justice-is-worth-fighting-for-a-qa-with-the-graduate-student-whose-hunger-strike-has-upended-the-university-of-missouri/" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a> and other national outlets and became The Maneater's most popular piece of content ever with over 200,000 views.</p>

            <p class="description">After MU's chancellor and system president resigned just hours apart following race-based student protests, our staff created a special online issue. I wrote two news stories, edited other stories and assisted in planning the issue and selecting visuals.</p>

            <p class="description">As a higher education reporter, I pitched the idea for an "explainer" on Title IX to make the policies more understandable for students. I gathered information, wrote the copy and assisted with the interactive web design.</p>

            <p>I've created a variety of interactive and print graphics to accompany stories. I'm interested in using data to tell stories that aren't as easily conveyed in words.</p>

            <p class="description">I looked into the namesakes of MU's buildings with another reporter, and we found that 77 out of 94 are named after white men. Using Google Fusion Tables, I created the interactive map below to accompany the story.</p> 

            <p class="description">Click on the dots for information about each building. The colors represent gender and ethnicity. Red &mdash; white male; green &mdash; white couple; yellow &mdash; white female; blue &mdash; black male; pink &mdash; company/foundation.</p>

            <p class="description">I used Tableau to create a series of graphics categorizing all Clery releases, which are emails informing MU students and employees of crimes reported on campus, that had been sent out since 2011. I also mapped where the incidents occurred on campus using Google Fusion Tables.</p>
